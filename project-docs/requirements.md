PRD:
- Build an Instagram Reels Data Extractor
- The app will extract data from an Instagram Reel URL and save it to a JSON file
- The app will start with a given URL.
- The app should use playwright to interact with the browser.
- The app should download the audio of the real video.
- The app should then scroll down to the next reel and repeat the process.
- The app should mimic a user behavior where the entire reel is played before scrolling down.
- The app should transcribe using OpenAI Whisper And save the data to a JSON file along with the necessary metadata.
- Store the JSON file in the output folder with reel ID as the name of the file along with timestamp.
